Guessing Number Game
My first project is a simple guessing number game.
This project used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
A user will be asked to guess a number between 1 and 100. If the number is too low or too high, a message will display to let the user know whether their number needs to be higher or lower. The game gives the user only ten guesses. If the user guesses correctly within ten guesses, he or she will win; if not, they lose. At the end of the game, there is a button to start another game if the user chooses to play again.

Calculator
My second project is a basic calculator.
This project used HTML, and CSS.
The project is to create a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). In HTML, I added buttons for 'AC', 'DEL', '.', '/', '', '+', '=', '00', '0', and '1-9'. I used CSS to customize the appearance of the calculator and applied styles to the buttons. Additionally, there are JavaScript tools embedded in the HTML file.

Guess My Word in Python
My third project involves guessing words in Python.
This project used Python and txt file.
A user will be asked to guess a 5-letter word. If the character is in the word, a message will display to let the user know whether their character is there, misplaced, or wrong. The game gives the user only 5 guesses. If the user guesses correctly within ten guesses, he or she will win; if not, they lose. the text file is use to stored 5-letter word; it act as a dictionary for the guessing word database.
