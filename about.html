        <h3>Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Prem Chhay, and I'm currently transitioning from a
          distinguished 20-year career in the U.S. Navy as a Culinary Specialist
          with an active Secret Clearance. My service allowed me to travel
          extensively, experiencing diverse cultures in countries such as Japan,
          South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Dubai, Bahrain, and Italy. Fluent in
          both English and Khmer, I bring a global perspective to my work.<br /><br />
          Upon completing my military service, I enrolled in the Washington Vets
          to Tech program, focusing on Cloud Application Development. I've
          gained proficiency in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, I'm
          eager to pivot into a new career in Software Development, and I'm
          particularly interested in opportunities with your company.<br /><br />
          With a strong background in management, problem-solving, team
          collaboration, and customer service, I believe I can bring valuable
          skills and a fresh perspective to your team for the long term.
        </p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          I graduated from San Gabriel High School in San Gabriel, California. I
          began my studies at the University of Riverside, majoring in Computer
          Engineering for a year. However, due to my family needing assistance,
          I paused my education and worked as a store clerk while attending
          Pasadena Community College in Pasadena, California. During this time,
          a Navy recruiter reached out to me with enticing offers such as
          citizenship and financial support for college.<br /><br />
          Seeking a stable career to support my living expenses, I joined the
          military. Throughout my military service, I managed to take college
          classes sporadically, although the demands of military service
          prevented me from completing a degree. Fortunately, I have been
          granted a second chance to pursue a career in the IT field, which has
          always been my aspiration.
        </p>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, I've gained proficiency in Python, SQL, HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript while attending the Washington Vets to Tech
          program (WaV2T).
        </p>
        <p>Below are my relevant skills:</p>
        <p>
          • Certified Military Leader • Instructor/Trainer • Microsoft Excel and
          Office Suite • Team Builder • Troubleshooting and Problem-Solving •
          Supervisor • Bilingual (English/Khmer) • Mentor • Budget Management •
          Counselor
        </p>

        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>
          I am interested in an entry-level role as a Cloud Applications
          Developer, Software Engineer, or in customer support roles. I am
          dedicated to continuous learning and personal growth. I excel in
          collaborative environments where I can leverage my skills to
          contribute to organizational success.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about video games, the evolution of the internet,
          technological advancements, robotics, AI, and innovations that enhance
          daily life. Leveraging my proficiency in mathematics up to calculus, I
          aspire to make a positive impact through information technology and
