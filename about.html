          "Hello, my name is Prem Chhay, and I'm currently transitioning from a
          distinguished 20-year career in the U.S. Navy as a Culinary Specialist
          with an active Secret Clearance. My service allowed me to travel
          extensively, experiencing diverse cultures in countries such as Japan,
          South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Dubai, Bahrain, and Italy. Fluent in
          both English and Khmer, I bring a global perspective to my work.<br /><br />
          Upon completing my military service, I enrolled in the Washington Vets
          to Tech program, focusing on Cloud Application Development. I've
          gained proficiency in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, I'm
          eager to pivot into a new career in Software Development, and I'm
          particularly interested in opportunities with your company.<br /><br />
          With a strong background in management, problem-solving, team
          collaboration, and customer service, I believe I can bring valuable
          skills and a fresh perspective to your team for the long term."
